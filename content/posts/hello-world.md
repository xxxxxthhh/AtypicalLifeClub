description: "The origin story of Atypical Life Club — why I decided to document my unconventional mix of tech, investing, and cross-border experiments."
---

After years of collecting notes in Notion, bookmarks in Raindrop, and thoughts scattered across too many messaging apps, I finally decided to consolidate everything into one place.

## The Problem with Private Notes

Private notes are great until you realize:

1. **You never revisit them** — They sit there, forgotten
2. **No feedback loop** — You don't know if your thinking is sound
3. **No accountability** — Easy to abandon half-baked ideas

Writing publicly changes the game. It forces you to actually finish thoughts, structure arguments, and consider whether what you're saying makes any sense.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog covers an **atypical mix** of topics:

### 🖥️ Technology
Infrastructure, automation, developer tools, and systems thinking. The kind of stuff I work on professionally but also tinker with endlessly at home.

### 📈 Investing
US and HK markets, portfolio management experiments, and the occasional deep dive into specific assets. Not financial advice — just documenting my own journey.

### 🌏 Cross-border Life
Navigating life between different countries, tax systems, and cultural contexts. The logistics nobody talks about.

### 📷 Cameras & Travel
Gear reviews, trip reports, and the art of disappearing from the grid occasionally.

## The Name

**Atypical Life Club** — because nothing about this mix of interests fits neatly into one category. 

Software engineer who trades options. IT consultant who collects film cameras. Singapore resident who spends too much time researching obscure tax treaties.

If you found this blog, you're probably someone with similarly scattered interests. Welcome to the club.

## What's Next

I'll be migrating some of my older notes and essays here over time. New posts will cover whatever I'm currently obsessing over — no fixed schedule, no content calendar, just genuine exploration.

If any of this resonates, stick around. And if you want to say hi, there's an [About](/about/) page with my contact info.

*Let's see where this goes.*
