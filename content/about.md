## 👋 Hi there!

I'm a **software engineer and IT consultant** based in Singapore, juggling infrastructure, automation, and way too many browser tabs.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog documents an **atypical mix** of:

- 🖥️ **Technology** — infrastructure, automation, dev tools, and systems thinking
- 📈 **Investing** — US/HK markets, portfolio management, and financial experiments  
- 🌏 **Cross-border Life** — navigating life between different countries and systems
- 📷 **Cameras & Travel** — gear, trips, and disappearing from the grid occasionally

---

## Who This Is For

Written for people who like to:

- Dig into **systems** and understand how things work
- **Manage their own capital** instead of outsourcing decisions
- Occasionally disappear on a trip instead of optimizing yet another sprint
