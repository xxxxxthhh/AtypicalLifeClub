## 5. Bull Case (Steel-Manned)

### Core Thesis

Jinpan is positioned to benefit from AI-driven data center power demand and SST commercialization, potentially delivering both earnings and valuation expansion through 2026-2027.

### Supporting Evidence

1. **AIDC demand is scaling rapidly**
- Data-center orders and revenue growth are highly visible
- New overseas data-center contracts add growth visibility

2. **Overseas expansion is becoming a structural driver**
- Overseas mix is rising with local manufacturing footprint expansion
- Localization helps mitigate tariff and delivery risks

3. **Digital manufacturing supports margin resilience**
- Process digitalization and capacity build-out improve productivity
- Mix shift toward higher-value products may improve profitability

### Key Bull Assumptions

1. SST moves from prototype to commercial scale on schedule
2. AI-related capex remains strong through 2027
3. New overseas plants ramp as planned
4. Competitive intensity remains manageable in core growth segments
5. Macro and trade environment remain broadly stable

### Upside Case

- 2026 profit reaches ~RMB 1.0B
- Market applies higher-growth multiple for AIDC-linked exposure
- Valuation upside can materialize if execution milestones are hit on time

---

## 6. Bear Case (Steel-Manned)

### Core Thesis

Current valuation already discounts substantial future growth. If SST commercialization, cash conversion, or competitive positioning underperform expectations, downside can be significant.

### Supporting Evidence

1. **Valuation leaves little margin of safety**
- TTM multiple remains elevated versus manufacturing peers
- High expectations are already embedded in price

2. **SST commercialization risk remains real**
- Prototype success does not guarantee rapid volume adoption
- Customer qualification cycles in critical power systems are long

3. **Receivables and cash-conversion pressure**
- Receivable base and days remain elevated
- If collection weakens, earnings quality and capital efficiency can deteriorate

4. **Domestic competition and overseas ramp uncertainty**
- Price competition can compress margins
- New factory ramps may take longer and dilute near-term returns

### Downside Case

- 2026 net profit undershoots market expectations
- Multiple compresses toward industrial average
- Large re-rating downside possible in a disappointment scenario

---

## 7. Key Uncertainties

1. Real-world SST economics and reliability at scale
2. Durability of AI-data-center capex cycle
3. Receivables quality and future write-off risk
4. Profitability of overseas capacity ramp
5. Competitor strategic response in SST/AIDC

### Thesis-Breaking Events

**Bull thesis invalidation signals:**
- No sizable SST orders after expected commercialization window
- AIDC growth slows materially below expected range
- Margins and cash conversion deteriorate

**Bear thesis invalidation signals:**
- SST orders exceed high-expectation thresholds
- Receivable turnover improves materially
- OCF-to-net-income conversion normalizes at high levels

## 8. Valuation Analysis

### 8.1 Multi-Method Framework

| Method | Implied Value | Key Assumption | Confidence |
|-------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| PE (Conservative) | ~RMB 20.0B | 2026 profit RMB 0.8B, 25x PE | Medium |
| PE (Base) | ~RMB 28.0B | 2026 profit RMB 0.8B, 35x PE | Medium |
| PE (Bull) | ~RMB 40.0B | 2026 profit RMB 1.0B, 40x PE | Low |
| Sum-of-Parts | ~RMB 31.6B | Legacy + AIDC + emerging segments | Medium |
| Current Market Cap | ~RMB 46.0B | Market pricing | - |

### 8.2 Interpretation

- Current pricing implies optimistic execution assumptions
- If growth or commercialization pace disappoints, valuation compression risk is material
