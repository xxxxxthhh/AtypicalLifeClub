## Executive Summary

**One-line thesis:** Tempus AI is precision medicine's "data flywheel" company — collecting data through diagnostic testing, analyzing it with AI, and licensing it to pharma. FY2025 revenue hit $1.27B (+83%), but GAAP losses persist, P/S ~8x, the CEO is a consistent seller, and short interest exceeds 20%. A high-growth, high-risk proposition.

**Investment Verdict:**
- Long-term theme (3-5 years): **Bullish**, **moderate** conviction
- Near-term entry: **Neutral-to-cautious**, valuation not cheap, heavy short pressure, need profitability inflection confirmation

## 1. Company Overview

Tempus AI was founded in 2015 by serial entrepreneur Eric Lefkofsky (also co-founder of Groupon), headquartered in Chicago. The company IPO'd on NASDAQ in June 2024.

### Core Business Model: The "Data Flywheel"

Tempus operates fundamentally differently from traditional diagnostics companies:

1. **Diagnostic Testing** (revenue engine): Genomic sequencing, hereditary cancer screening, MRD testing for hospitals and physicians
2. **Data Collection** (moat builder): Every test adds de-identified clinical + molecular data to the proprietary dataset
3. **Data Licensing** (high-margin): Licensing accumulated datasets to pharma for drug development and clinical trial design
4. **AI Applications** (future growth): Building AI models on the data to assist clinical decision-making

The flywheel: **More tests → more data → better AI models → more hospitals adopt → more tests**.

### Business Mix

| Segment | FY2025 Revenue | Growth | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Diagnostics** | ~$955M | +111% | Oncology genomics (xT/xF/xR), hereditary cancer (Ambry), MRD |
| **Data & Applications** | ~$316M | +31% | Data licensing (Insights) + AI applications (Algos/Apps) |

### Key Acquisitions

| Acquisition | Date | Value | Significance |
|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Ambry Genetics** | Feb 2025 | $600M ($375M cash + $225M stock) | Hereditary cancer testing, major diagnostics revenue boost |
| **Paige** | Aug 2025 | $81.25M (stock) | Digital pathology AI, 7M pathology slides |
| **Deep 6 AI** | 2024 | Undisclosed | Clinical trial matching, 30M patient records |

## 2. Industry Context: AI-Powered Precision Medicine

### 2.1 Market Size

- Global precision medicine: ~$85B (2025) → ~$175B (2030E), ~15% CAGR
- Genomic diagnostics: ~$25B (2025) → ~$50B (2030E)
- Healthcare AI: ~$20B (2025) → ~$70B+ (2030E)

### 2.2 Why Data Is the Core Moat

The bottleneck in precision medicine isn't algorithms — it's **data**:
- Clinical data is fragmented across thousands of hospital EMR systems
- Molecular data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) requires standardized processing
- Linking clinical outcomes to molecular data requires long-term tracking
- Data access is strictly regulated (HIPAA)

Tempus collects first-party data directly through its diagnostics business, bypassing traditional data aggregation fragmentation.

### 2.3 Competitive Landscape

| Company | Position | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Tempus AI** | Full-stack precision medicine platform | Data flywheel, multimodal data, AI capability | Still unprofitable, high valuation |
| **Foundation Medicine** (Roche) | Comprehensive genomic profiling | Roche resources, multiple FDA approvals | Innovation slowed post-acquisition |
| **Guardant Health** | Liquid biopsy | Blood-based testing leadership | Narrow data dimensions |
| **Natera** | MRD/NIPT | MRD testing leader, strong reimbursement | Small data licensing business |
| **Exact Sciences** | Cancer screening | Cologuard brand, large-scale commercialization | Weak AI capabilities |

**Tempus's differentiation:** The only company simultaneously operating large-scale diagnostics + data licensing + AI applications as a full-stack platform.

## 3. Financial Analysis

### 3.1 Revenue Growth

| Period | Revenue | YoY Growth | Organic Growth |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| FY2023 | $532M | +21% | ~21% |
| FY2024 | $693M | +30% | ~30% |
| **FY2025** | **$1.27B** | **+83%** | **~33.5%** |
| Q4 2025 | $367.2M | +83% | +33.5% |
| **FY2026E (guidance)** | **$1.59B** | **+25%** | TBD |

**Critical distinction:** Roughly half of FY2025's 83% headline growth came from the Ambry Genetics acquisition. Organic growth of ~33.5% is still strong but far below the headline number.

### 3.2 Profitability

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Trend |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Adjusted Gross Margin | 64.7% | Improving (+391bps YoY) |
| Adjusted EPS | -$0.04 | Narrowing sharply (vs -$0.16) |
| GAAP EPS | -$0.31 | Still deeply negative |
| Q4 Net Loss | -$54.2M | SBC and acquisition costs drag |

**Key inflection:** 2026 guidance of ~$65M adjusted EBITDA would be the company's first meaningful profitability in 10 years. But GAAP profitability remains distant (massive SBC).

### 3.3 Balance Sheet

- Cash & marketable securities: $759.7M
- Total remaining contract value: >$1.1B
- Net revenue retention: 126% (excellent)
- No significant debt pressure

### 3.4 Valuation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/S (TTM) | ~8x |
| P/S (2026E) | ~6x |
| EV/Revenue (TTM) | ~9x |
| EV/Revenue (2026E) | ~7x |
| Forward P/E | N/A (still unprofitable) |
| EV/2026E EBITDA | ~150x+ |

P/S of 8x isn't outrageous for 83% growth, but organic growth is only 33.5% and 2026 guidance decelerates to 25%. At 25% growth + losses, P/S 6-8x is not cheap.

## 4. Management & Governance

### Eric Lefkofsky (Founder & CEO)

- Groupon co-founder (controversial track record)
- Controls 59.9% voting power via dual-class share structure
- **Persistent selling:** 54+ sales totaling ~$127M, zero purchases
- Most recent: Feb 20, 2026 — sold 166,250 shares (~$9.8M)
- Still holds ~8.9M shares (~$520M)

### Governance Risks

- **Dual-class structure:** CEO controls ~60% voting power; minority shareholders have minimal influence
- **Consistent insider selling:** Never bought, only sold — a negative signal
- **ESOP shelf registration:** Recent filing raised dilution concerns

## 5. Bull vs. Bear Case

### 🐂 Bull Case

1. **Data flywheel moat (moderate-high conviction)** — Legal barriers (HIPAA) + network effects make the dataset non-replicable. 126% NRR proves stickiness.
2. **Precision medicine megatrend (high conviction)** — AI + genomics transforming healthcare is a secular trend. Market doubles by 2030.
3. **Profitability inflection (moderate conviction)** — 2026 guidance of $65M adjusted EBITDA is the first meaningful profit in 10 years.
4. **MRD explosion (moderate conviction)** — Q4 MRD volume +56% QoQ. Medicare reimbursement would be a major catalyst.
5. **Acquisition integration (moderate conviction)** — Ambry and Paige expand data dimensions and strengthen the flywheel.

### 🐻 Bear Case

1. **Organic growth decelerating (high conviction)** — Half of 83% headline growth is acquisition-driven. Organic at 33.5%, 2026 guidance drops to 25%.
2. **GAAP still deeply unprofitable (fact)** — Q4 GAAP EPS -$0.31, full-year net loss >$200M. Adjusted EBITDA excludes massive SBC.
3. **CEO persistent selling (fact)** — $127M+ in cumulative sales, zero purchases. Dual-class structure prevents minority shareholder pushback. Biggest governance red flag.
4. **Extremely high short interest (fact)** — 20.6% short float means significant bearish conviction. Short reports could surface at any time.
5. **Valuation not cheap (moderate-high conviction)** — P/S 8x, EV/2026E EBITDA 150x+ for a still-unprofitable, decelerating-growth company.
6. **Data licensing growth lags diagnostics (moderate conviction)** — Data & Apps grew 31% vs. Diagnostics 111%. If the high-margin business can't accelerate, margin expansion is limited.

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Scorecard

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Business Quality | 8/10 | Unique data flywheel model, 126% NRR |
| Competitive Moat | 7/10 | Strong data moat, but Roche/Guardant competitive |
| Financial Health | 5/10 | Cash-rich but persistent GAAP losses |
| Management | 4/10 | CEO persistent selling + dual-class governance |
| Valuation | 5/10 | P/S 8x not outrageous but not cheap |
| Catalyst Clarity | 7/10 | MRD reimbursement, EBITDA inflection, FDA pathways |
| Growth Sustainability | 7/10 | Organic growth decelerating but still 30%+ |

### Bottom Line

Tempus AI is precision medicine's most ambitious "full-stack" player — diagnostics + data + AI in a unique flywheel. $1.27B revenue, 83% growth, and 126% NRR prove strong product-market fit.

But the other side is equally prominent: organic growth is only 33.5% and decelerating, GAAP losses persist, the CEO has sold $127M+ without a single purchase, and 20%+ short interest signals significant bearish conviction. P/S 8x demands near-perfect execution on the profitability inflection.

The 2026 Q1-Q2 earnings will be the critical validation window for organic growth trends and EBITDA trajectory.
