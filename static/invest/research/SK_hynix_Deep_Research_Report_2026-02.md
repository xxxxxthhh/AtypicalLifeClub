## Executive Summary

**One-line thesis:** SK hynix is the global HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) monopolist — 53% market share, exclusive NVIDIA partnership, 49% operating margin — yet trades at just 5.3x forward P/E, making it arguably the strongest-fundamental, most-undervalued semiconductor company globally. The main barrier is investability (Korean-listed only).

**Investment Verdict:**
- Long-term theme (3-5 years): **Strongly Bullish**, **high** conviction
- Near-term entry: **Bullish**, valuation extremely attractive, but memory cycle risk exists

## 1. Company Overview

SK hynix is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker (behind Samsung Electronics) and the dominant leader in HBM. Founded in 1983, headquartered in Icheon, South Korea. Parent company SK Square holds ~20% equity.

### Business Mix

| Segment | Revenue Share | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **DRAM** | ~73% | Including HBM, DDR5, LPDDR5 |
| **NAND** | ~27% | Rose to global #2 after acquiring Intel's NAND business in 2021 |

### HBM: The Profit Engine

HBM is high-performance memory designed for AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs), achieving extreme bandwidth through vertical stacking of DRAM dies.

- HBM ASP is 5-6x conventional DRAM
- HBM margins estimated at 60-70%+
- Growing share of DRAM revenue, now the core profit driver

## 2. Industry Context: AI-Driven Memory Supercycle

### 2.1 Why HBM Is Irreplaceable

| Metric | DDR5 | HBM3e | HBM4 |
|--------|------|-------|------|
| Bandwidth | ~50 GB/s | ~1.2 TB/s | ~2.8 TB/s |
| Stack Layers | 1 | 12 | 16 |
| Interface Width | 64-bit | 1024-bit | 2048-bit |

### 2.2 Demand Explosion

- Each NVIDIA Blackwell GPU requires 8 HBM3e stacks
- NVIDIA Rubin (2026-2027) will use HBM4
- Global AI infrastructure capex exceeds $300B in 2026
- HBM market: $16B (2024) → $40B+ (2026E) → $70B+ (2028E)

### 2.3 Supply Landscape

| Company | HBM Share | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| SK hynix | 53% | Leader, NVIDIA's primary supplier |
| Samsung | ~35% | Catching up, HBM3e yield improving |
| Micron | ~12% | Smallest share, technology catch-up |

## 3. Financial Analysis

### 3.1 Revenue & Profit (FY2025 Record)

| Period | Revenue | Operating Profit | Margin |
|--------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| FY2023 | ₩32.8T | -₩7.7T | -23% |
| FY2024 | ₩66.2T | ₩23.5T | 35% |
| **FY2025** | **₩97.1T** | **₩47.2T** | **49%** |
| Q4 2025 | ₩32.8T | ₩19.2T | 58% |

**Milestone:** First time surpassing Samsung Electronics in annual profit (Samsung OP: ₩43.6T).

### 3.2 Analyst Forecasts

**Macquarie (Feb 2026, sharply raised):**
- FY26E OP: ~₩30T (~$20.8B)
- FY27E OP: ~₩47.7T (~$33B)
- Target price: ₩1,700,000 (+91% upside)

### 3.3 Valuation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TTM P/E | 14.2x |
| Forward P/E | 5.3x |
| P/S | ~6.3x |
| Dividend Yield | ~1% |

Forward P/E of 5.3x for a company with 49% margins and 100%+ profit growth is extraordinarily cheap by any global standard.

## 4. HBM Technology Roadmap & Competition

### 4.1 Technology Evolution

| Generation | Stack | Bandwidth | Mass Production | SK hynix Position |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| HBM3 | 8-layer | 819 GB/s | 2023 | Leader |
| HBM3e | 12-layer | 1.2 TB/s | 2024-2025 | NVIDIA exclusive/primary |
| HBM4 | 12-16 layer | 2.8 TB/s | 2026 H2 | Competition intensifying |

### 4.2 HBM4: The Competitive Inflection

- All three (SK hynix, Samsung, Micron) have submitted 16-Hi HBM4 samples to NVIDIA
- Samsung reports 11.7 Gbps/pin test speed (SK hynix targets 10 Gbps)
- NVIDIA Rubin GPU will be the first HBM4 customer
- SK hynix's exclusive advantage may narrow in the HBM4 era

### 4.3 Moat Assessment

**Strong:** Advanced packaging (TSV, hybrid bonding) 12-18 month lead; deep NVIDIA co-development; yield advantage; 2026 capacity sold out.

**Weakening:** Samsung HBM4 catch-up accelerating; Micron gaining U.S. policy support; HBM4 architecture changes may reset competition.

## 5. Investment Routes for Non-Korean Investors

SK hynix is listed on KRX only. No U.S. ADR exists (under consideration). Available options:

### 5.1 ETF Route (Most Convenient)

| ETF | SK hynix Weight | Notes | Expense Ratio |
|-----|----------------|-------|---------------|
| **EWY** | 19% | iShares MSCI South Korea; Samsung 27.8% + SK hynix 19% = 47% | 0.59% |
| **AGIX** | Exposure | KraneShares AI & Technology ETF | 0.68% |

**EWY is the most direct option**, but note: you're also buying Samsung, Hyundai, and the Korean economy.

### 5.2 Parent Company: SK Square (071050.KS)

- Holds ~20% of SK hynix
- Trades at typical holding company discount (30-50%)
- Requires Korean brokerage account

### 5.3 Related U.S.-Listed Beneficiaries

| Stock | Thesis | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Micron (MU)** | Direct competitor | Most direct U.S.-listed HBM play |
| **NVIDIA (NVDA)** | Largest customer | Source of HBM demand |
| **Applied Materials (AMAT)** | Equipment supplier | HBM manufacturing equipment |
| **Lam Research (LRCX)** | Equipment supplier | Etch and deposition |
| **ASML** | Lithography | All advanced memory requires EUV |

### 5.4 Direct Korean Brokerage

- Interactive Brokers supports KRX
- Buy 000660.KS directly
- Consider: Korean capital gains tax, KRW/USD FX risk, trading hours

## 6. Bull vs. Bear Case

### 🐂 Bull Case

1. **HBM monopoly** — 53% share + NVIDIA lock-in. 2026 capacity sold out.
2. **Extreme undervaluation** — Forward P/E 5.3x for 49% margins and 100%+ growth.
3. **AI capex supercycle** — $300B+ hyperscaler capex in 2026. HBM is the highest-certainty AI beneficiary.
4. **Technology lead** — 12-18 month yield advantage over Samsung in advanced packaging.
5. **Improving shareholder returns** — Record FY2025 dividends, Korea Value-up program.

### 🐻 Bear Case

1. **Memory cyclicality** — Industry cycles every 3-4 years. FY2023 was a massive loss year.
2. **HBM4 competition** — Samsung catching up, exclusive premium may shrink.
3. **HBM pricing pressure** — 10-15% price decline possible in H2 2026 as supply increases.
4. **Customer concentration** — Heavy NVIDIA dependence.
5. **Korea Discount** — Chaebol governance, minority shareholder protection concerns.
6. **Geopolitics** — Korean semiconductors caught in US-China tensions.

## 7. Overall Assessment

### Scorecard

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Business Quality | 9/10 | HBM monopoly + 49% margins |
| Competitive Moat | 8/10 | Tech lead but HBM4 competition rising |
| Financial Health | 9/10 | Profit explosion, cash-rich |
| Management | 6/10 | Chaebol governance, but improving capital allocation |
| Valuation | 9/10 | Forward P/E 5.3x, extremely undervalued |
| Investability | 5/10 | Korean-listed only, indirect routes have friction |
| Catalyst Clarity | 8/10 | HBM4 ramp, NVIDIA Rubin, potential ADR listing |

### Bottom Line

SK hynix is one of the AI era's most essential "picks and shovels" — if NVIDIA is AI's brain, SK hynix is AI's memory. A forward P/E of 5.3x for a monopolist with 49% margins is an opportunity that barely exists in U.S. markets.

The main barrier isn't fundamentals — it's access. EWY for indirect exposure (accepting Korean economy risk), Interactive Brokers for direct KRX access, or Micron (MU) as the closest U.S.-listed proxy.
