| Revenue | ~$870M | ~$1.48B | $2.34-2.36B | 🔺 Strong acceleration |
| Revenue Growth | ~47% | ~70% | +58-59% | 🔺 High but decelerating |
| Gross Margin | ~80% | ~78% | ~75% | 🔻 Declining |
| Subscribers | ~1.5M | ~2.2M | ~2.5M+ | 🔺 Growing but slowing |
| ARPU (monthly) | ~$50 | ~$64 | ~$80 | 🔺 Strong expansion |

### Profitability

- Q3 2025 net income: $15.8M (vs $75.6M in Q3 2024, which included a significant tax benefit)
- Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA: $78.4M (vs $51.1M in Q3 2024, +53%)
- EPS dropped sharply from $0.32 (Q3 2024) to $0.06 (Q3 2025)
- Gross margin compression from 79% to 74%, primarily due to higher-cost GLP-1 injectables

### Balance Sheet

- Issued $1.1B in convertible notes (0% interest) in 2025 for international expansion and R&D
- Strong liquidity: $1.07B cash
- Debt burden has increased significantly, requiring sustained high growth to support

### Red Flag Check

- ⚠️ Gross margin declining steadily (80% → 74%), GLP-1 business dragging down overall profitability
- ⚠️ EPS declining sharply, operating expenses growing faster than revenue
- ⚠️ $1.1B convertible notes increase financial leverage
- ⚠️ Sustainability of GLP-1-related revenue is questionable
- ✅ Cash flow positive, ample liquidity
- ✅ Non-GLP-1 business accounts for ~70% of revenue — solid core

## 4. Management Assessment

### CEO Andrew Dudum

- Company founder, leading since 2017
- Successfully expanded from single-category men's health to multi-category platform
- Adopted aggressive stance on GLP-1 controversy, publicly confronting FDA and Novo Nordisk
- Characterized Novo Nordisk lawsuit as a "blatant attack by Big Pharma on consumer choice"

### Strategic Execution

- ✅ Strong execution on user growth and ARPU expansion
- ✅ International expansion (acquired ZAVA for UK/Germany/France presence, Canada planned for 2026)
- ⚠️ Overly aggressive GLP-1 strategy triggered regulatory backlash
- ⚠️ Launched compounded semaglutide oral pill in Feb 2026, forced to withdraw within days

### Management Grade: B-

Strong operational execution but poor judgment on GLP-1 strategy. The aggressive market approach invited avoidable regulatory and legal risks.

## 5. 🐂 Bull Case

**Core Thesis:** Hims & Hers' core business (ex-GLP-1) remains robust, and the brand + subscription model creates a sustainable growth engine. The current stock price has overreacted to GLP-1 risks.

**Supporting Evidence:**

1. **Non-GLP-1 business is ~70% of revenue:** Even if GLP-1 business goes to zero, the company retains ~$1.6B in annual revenue from hair loss, ED, skincare, and mental health — categories with minimal regulatory risk
2. **ARPU continues to expand:** $50 → $64 → $80/month, reflecting successful personalization and cross-selling. User value is deepening
3. **2.5M subscribers with >85% retention:** Subscription model provides highly predictable revenue with strong user stickiness
4. **International expansion opens new growth vectors:** ZAVA acquisition provides European footprint (UK, Germany, France), Canada launch in 2026 reduces U.S. single-market dependency
5. **New category expansion:** Testosterone health, biomarker testing, longevity specialty could become the next growth engines

**Key Assumptions:**
- GLP-1 regulatory risk does not spill over to other business lines
- International expansion contributes meaningful revenue within 12-18 months
- Brand strength maintains user acquisition efficiency amid rising competition

**Upside Scenario:** If GLP-1 regulatory issues resolve with fines/restrictions (rather than a total ban) and non-GLP-1 business maintains 30%+ growth, the stock could rebound 50-80% from current levels.

---

## 6. 🐻 Bear Case

**Core Thesis:** The GLP-1 regulatory storm is far from over and could trigger cascading effects, while the company's core competitive advantages (generic drugs + convenient delivery) lack a true moat.

**Supporting Evidence:**

1. **Novo Nordisk patent lawsuit (Feb 9, 2026):** Filed in Delaware federal court alleging patent infringement, seeking permanent injunction and damages. If Hims loses, the GLP-1 business is terminated entirely
2. **DOJ investigation (Feb 6, 2026):** HHS referred Hims to the Department of Justice for potential violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This threatens not just GLP-1 but the company's overall compliance reputation
3. **Gross margin deterioration:** From 80% to 74%, driven by high-cost GLP-1 injectables and increased operational complexity from personalized solutions
4. **Growth deceleration signals:** Q3 2025 sequential revenue growth was only 2.2%, subscriber growth flattening — the hypergrowth phase may be ending
5. **$1.1B convertible notes:** While 0% interest seems favorable, sustained stock price weakness could lead to massive shareholder dilution upon conversion
6. **Intensifying competition:** Ro, LifeMD, and others continue to close the gap across categories, while traditional healthcare systems accelerate digitization

**Key Risks:**
- DOJ investigation escalates to formal prosecution, resulting in significant fines and business restrictions
- Novo Nordisk wins injunction, GLP-1 revenue goes to zero
- Regulatory uncertainty erodes user trust, spilling over to non-GLP-1 business
- Convertible debt dilution + growth slowdown creates a "Davis Double Play" downside

**Downside Scenario:** If DOJ formally prosecutes + Novo Nordisk obtains injunction, GLP-1 business (~30% of revenue) goes to zero. Combined with brand reputation damage slowing non-GLP-1 growth to 15-20%, the stock could decline another 30-50%.

---

## 7. Key Uncertainties

### ❓ What We Don't Know

1. **DOJ investigation trajectory:** Currently at the "referral" stage — no formal case has been opened. If it escalates to a full investigation/prosecution, the impact extends far beyond GLP-1. Expect clearer signals within 3-6 months.

2. **Novo Nordisk lawsuit timeline and outcome:** Patent litigation typically takes 1-3 years, but a preliminary injunction could come within months. Critical question: Will the court issue a preliminary injunction during litigation?

3. **FDA's final policy on compounded drugs:** The FDA is tightening regulation of compounded GLP-1 drugs, but the final policy framework remains unclear. This affects not just Hims but the entire compounding industry.

4. **True growth rate of non-GLP-1 business:** Company disclosures make it difficult to precisely isolate the growth contributions of GLP-1 vs. non-GLP-1 segments.

### Thesis-Breaking Events

- If DOJ investigation fizzles + Novo Nordisk lawsuit settles → Bear case invalidated
- If FDA bans GLP-1 compounding entirely + DOJ formally prosecutes → Bull case severely damaged

## 8. Valuation Context

### Current Valuation

The stock peaked in February 2025 and has declined significantly through early 2026. The 3-month drawdown is approximately 55.8%, with a 34% decline in the most recent month alone.

| Method | Range | Assumptions | Confidence |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|
| P/S (incl. GLP-1) | 1.5-2.5x FY2025E | Peer comparison | Medium |
| P/S (ex-GLP-1) | 2.5-4x core revenue | Non-GLP-1 only | Medium-High |
| EV/EBITDA | 15-25x FY2025E | Growth-stage health platform | Medium |
| DCF (Base) | Highly dependent on GLP-1 assumptions | High uncertainty | Low |

### Peer Comparison

| Company | P/S (TTM) | Revenue Growth | Gross Margin |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| HIMS | ~2x | +49% | 74% |
| Teladoc (TDOC) | ~1x | ~3% | ~68% |
| LifeMD (LFMD) | ~1.5x | ~30% | ~70% |

Hims' growth rate far exceeds peers, but the regulatory risk premium significantly compresses its valuation multiple.

## 9. Catalysts & Timeline

### Near-Term (0-6 months)
- ⚡ Whether DOJ formally opens investigation (most critical catalyst)
- ⚡ Whether Novo Nordisk seeks preliminary injunction
- ⚡ Q4 2025 earnings (expected Feb-Mar 2026)
- ⚡ Further FDA policy statements on compounded GLP-1 drugs

### Medium-Term (6-18 months)
- International business (Europe/Canada) revenue contribution begins
- New category (testosterone, Labs, longevity) user growth data
- GLP-1 litigation progress
- Convertible note dilution impact on equity

### Long-Term (18+ months)
- Telehealth industry consolidation trends
- Whether the company successfully transforms into a comprehensive digital health platform
- Whether international markets can replicate U.S. growth patterns

## 10. Conclusion

Hims & Hers is a well-executed DTC telehealth company that has built an impressive base of 2.5 million subscribers in just a few years. The non-GLP-1 business (~70% of revenue) is growing steadily, and the brand and user experience lead the category.

However, the company faces its most severe challenge since founding: the dual threat of Novo Nordisk's patent lawsuit and a DOJ investigation. These risks threaten not just the GLP-1 business itself but could damage overall brand credibility and user trust. Management's aggressive GLP-1 strategy (launching an oral pill only to withdraw it days later) reveals questionable judgment.

**The Core Tension:** Excellent core business vs. self-inflicted regulatory trouble.

**What Investors Should Watch:**
1. Whether the DOJ investigation escalates (the single most important variable)
2. Whether non-GLP-1 business can sustain 30%+ independent growth
3. Early data from international expansion

The stock has already pulled back significantly. If regulatory risks resolve benignly, there is meaningful upside. But if the DOJ formally prosecutes, downside risk remains substantial. This is a highly binary, event-driven investment thesis.
