## Executive Summary

**One-line thesis:** Almonty is the world's most important non-Chinese tungsten producer, with its flagship Sangdong mine just entering commercial production amid a 40% contraction in Chinese tungsten exports and U.S. defense mandates — but a $4B market cap on $21.5M TTM revenue means the stock is priced for perfection.

**Investment Verdict:**
- Long-term theme (3-5 years): **Bullish**, **medium-high** conviction
- Near-term entry (current price): **Cautious**, valuation fully reflects or exceeds optimistic expectations

## 2. Industry Context: Structural Shift in Tungsten Markets

### 2.1 Why Tungsten Matters

Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal (3,422°C) with extreme density and hardness — an irreplaceable strategic metal:

- **Cemented carbide/cutting tools:** ~65% of global tungsten consumption
- **Defense:** Armor-piercing rounds, high-density alloys, advanced weapons
- **Semiconductors/AI:** Interconnect layers, barrier layers, thermal management
- **EVs:** Tungsten carbide tooling, electrodes, hydrogen fuel cell catalysts

### 2.2 Supply Landscape: Chinese Monopoly Under Pressure

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| China's market share | 80%+ of global tungsten supply |
| Export controls | Export licensing since 2025, only 15 firms authorized |
| Export contraction | Chinese tungsten exports down ~40% YoY |
| Price impact | Tungsten concentrate up ~150% YoY, APT expected at $460/MTU |

### 2.3 Demand Drivers

- Global tungsten demand expected to grow 25% in 2026
- Market size from $7.6B to $11.6B by 2035
- U.S. bans Chinese tungsten in defense applications from 2027
- U.S. "Project Vault" $12B strategic stockpile program (launched Feb 2026)

## 6. Competitive Landscape

| **EQ Resources** | Barruecopardo (Spain) + Mt. Carbine (Australia) | Operating | Medium |
| **Wolfram** | Mittersill, Austria | Operating | Medium — largest European deposit |

## 7. Valuation

### Current Multiples

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| EV/TTM Revenue | ~191x |
| EV/2026E Revenue ($120M) | ~34x |
| EV/2026E Revenue ($155M) | ~27x |
| FY2026 EPS estimate | $0.23 |
| Forward P/E (on $0.23) | ~60x |

### Analyst Ratings

| Source | Rating | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Consensus | Moderate Buy / Strong Buy | $13.38 - $15.95 |
| DA Davidson | Buy | $18.00 |
| Oppenheimer | — | $12.00 |

The $4B market cap implies Sangdong executes flawlessly, tungsten prices stay elevated, and all expansion projects succeed. EV/2026E Revenue of 27-34x is aggressive for a mining company just entering production.

## 8. Bull vs. Bear Case

### 🐂 Bull Case

1. **Geopolitical moat** — China's 40% export contraction is structural, not cyclical. Almonty is the primary beneficiary.
2. **Revenue inflection** — 5-8x revenue jump from TTM to 2026E is high-certainty (mine is already producing ore).
3. **Offtake floor** — Plansee's $235/MTU floor provides downside protection even if tungsten prices halve.
4. **Policy tailwinds** — U.S. 2027 defense ban + $12B Project Vault are irreversible policy directions.
5. **Growth optionality** — Montana project + molybdenum + Phase II provide 2027-2028 growth catalysts.
6. **Aligned management** — 39% insider ownership, CEO didn't sell during 250% rally.

### 🐻 Bear Case

1. **Extreme valuation** — EV/2026E Revenue 27-34x prices in perfection for a mining company.
2. **Execution risk** — Processing plant stabilization is the key unknown. Mining delays are the norm, not the exception.
3. **Severe dilution** — 50% share count increase in one year. Further financing likely for expansion.
4. **No positive EBITDA** — Still cash-burning, Altman Z-Score in distress zone.
5. **Tungsten price reversal** — Current prices include panic premium. Chinese policy reversal could crash prices.
6. **Single-asset concentration** — Nearly all value depends on one mine.
7. **Rising competition** — Multiple companies targeting the same non-Chinese supply gap.

## 9. Key Uncertainties & Monitoring Points

| Timeline | Event | Importance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Q1/Q2 2026 | Sangdong first commercial revenue recognition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| H1 2026 | Processing plant utilization data | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Ongoing | APT price trajectory (sustaining $400+/MTU?) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| H2 2026 | Montana project permitting progress | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Q4 2026 | Molybdenum drilling results | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 2027 | Phase II expansion launch | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## 10. Overall Assessment

### Scorecard

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Business Quality | 7/10 | Scarce non-Chinese tungsten asset, but single-mine concentration |
| Competitive Moat | 8/10 | Geopolitical moat + 15-year offtake + defense customers |
| Financial Health | 4/10 | Negative EBITDA, heavy dilution, Z-Score warning; but cash-rich |
| Management | 7/10 | Long tenure, aligned incentives, defense-connected board |
| Valuation | 3/10 | EV/Revenue 27-34x, priced for perfection or beyond |
| Catalyst Clarity | 8/10 | Sangdong ramp, tungsten prices, U.S. policy all near-term |

### Bottom Line

Almonty is a "high-conviction, high-risk" story. The core thesis — the West needs non-Chinese tungsten, and Almonty is the largest supplier — is solid. But a $4B market cap demands near-perfect execution, and mining projects rarely deliver perfection.

**Suitable for:**
- ✅ Investors comfortable with high volatility who believe in the critical minerals secular theme
- ✅ Existing holders considering adding on pullbacks

**Not suitable for:**
- ❌ Investors seeking stable cash flows or low volatility
- ❌ New positions at current prices (valuation fully reflects optimism)
