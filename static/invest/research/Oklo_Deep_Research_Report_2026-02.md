| **FY 2025 Guidance** | - | **$65-80M cash burn** | Reaffirmed |

### Key Financial Observations

**Strengths:**
1. **Strong Cash Position:** $1.2B+ in cash and marketable securities as of Q3 2025
2. **Successful Capital Raise:** $460M equity offering in Q2 2025 provides runway
3. **Minimal Debt:** Total liabilities only $40.6M (Q3 2025)
4. **Controlled Burn Rate:** Cash burn within guided range ($65-80M for 2025)
5. **Interest Income:** Generating $7.7M annually from cash reserves

**Concerns:**
1. **Pre-Revenue Status:** Zero revenue with no near-term revenue expected until late 2027
2. **Increasing Losses:** Operating losses growing as development accelerates
3. **Capital Intensity Ahead:** Will need billions to build powerhouse fleet
4. **Burn Rate Acceleration:** Q3 2025 operating loss ($36.3M) suggests increasing spend
5. **Dilution Risk:** Future capital raises likely needed before revenue generation

### Cash Runway Analysis

**Current Situation (Q3 2025):**
- Cash: $1.2 billion
- Annual burn rate: $65-80M (2025 guidance)
- **Implied runway: 15-18 years at current burn rate**

**Reality Check:**
This calculation is misleading because:
1. **Pre-construction phase:** Current burn rate reflects R&D and regulatory work
2. **Construction phase:** Building first Aurora powerhouse will require $100M+ in capital
3. **Scaling phase:** Each additional powerhouse requires significant capital investment
4. **Fuel recycling facility:** $1.68B investment planned for Oak Ridge facility

**Realistic Capital Needs (2026-2028):**
- Regulatory and pre-construction: $150-200M
- First Aurora powerhouse construction: $200-400M (estimated)
- Fuel recycling facility: $1.68B (phased investment)
- **Total estimated need: $2-2.3B before first revenue**

**Conclusion:** Oklo will likely need additional capital raises (equity or debt) before achieving positive cash flow, creating dilution risk for current shareholders.

## 5. Bull Case (Steel-Manned)

**Core Thesis:** Oklo is positioned to capture a significant share of the exploding AI/data center power market with differentiated fast reactor technology, strong customer commitments, and vertical integration that creates a sustainable competitive advantage in the emerging SMR industry.

### Supporting Evidence

**1. Massive and Growing TAM with Perfect Timing**

The AI revolution has created unprecedented power demand that traditional grid infrastructure cannot meet:
- **Data center power demand:** Growing exponentially with AI model training and inference
- **Switch agreement alone:** 12 GW represents $10B+ in potential revenue over 20 years
- **Total pipeline:** 14 GW could generate $15-20B in lifetime revenue
- **Market timing:** Oklo will come online (2027-2028) just as data center power crunch intensifies
- **Competitive advantage:** Nuclear provides 24/7 baseload power that renewables + storage cannot match economically

**Data point:** If Oklo achieves even 20% of its 14 GW pipeline at $80/MWh average pricing and 90% capacity factor, that's ~$2B in annual revenue at maturity.

**2. Differentiated Technology with Real Advantages**

Oklo's fast reactor technology offers genuine benefits over competitors:
- **Fuel recycling:** 90%+ energy extraction from used fuel = 80% fuel cost savings
- **Waste reduction:** Addresses nuclear industry's biggest public perception problem
- **Passive safety:** "Walk-away safe" design reduces operational complexity and risk
- **Flexible capacity:** 15-75 MW range fits diverse customer needs better than fixed-size competitors
- **20-year core life:** Minimal refueling downtime vs. traditional reactors
- **Heritage technology:** 400+ reactor-years of fast reactor experience reduces technical risk

**3. Vertical Integration Creates Sustainable Moat**

The Oak Ridge fuel recycling facility is a strategic masterstroke:
- **Supply chain control:** Reduces dependence on external HALEU suppliers (major bottleneck)
- **Cost advantage:** Recycled fuel at 80% cost savings vs. fresh HALEU
- **Barrier to entry:** $1.68B facility investment competitors must match
- **Additional revenue:** Radioisotope production creates diversified income stream
- **Regulatory advantage:** Demonstrates closed fuel cycle to NRC and public

**4. Business Model Superiority**

Power-as-a-Service model is better than reactor sales:
- **Recurring revenue:** 20+ year PPAs create predictable cash flows
- **Customer simplicity:** Data centers avoid nuclear licensing and operational complexity
- **Asset ownership:** Oklo captures full value chain, not just equipment margin
- **Scalability:** Once first unit proves economics, can rapidly deploy fleet
- **Valuation multiple:** Utility-like recurring revenue commands higher multiples than equipment sales

**5. Regulatory Path Clearing**

Despite 2022 denial, regulatory progress is accelerating:
- **NRC modernization:** Agency actively streamlining advanced reactor approvals
- **Learning from denial:** Second COLA application will be more comprehensive
- **Pre-application progress:** Phase 1 readiness complete, PDC accepted for review
- **Political support:** Bipartisan backing for nuclear energy and energy independence
- **DOE site access:** Idaho National Laboratory site secured for first deployment

**6. Financial Strength to Execute**

Unlike many pre-revenue companies, Oklo has capital to reach commercialization:
- **$1.2B+ cash:** Sufficient runway to first revenue without dilution
- **Proven capital access:** Successfully raised $460M in 2025
- **Sam Altman network:** Access to Silicon Valley capital and tech industry customers
- **Institutional support:** 85% institutional ownership with net buying in Q4 2025

- **Implied valuation: $35-50B**
- **Upside from current: +190% to +310%**

**Conclusion:** Bull case requires near-perfect execution and aggressive deployment to justify current valuation in medium term, but offers substantial upside in long term (5-10 years) if Oklo becomes dominant SMR player.

---

## 6. Bear Case (Steel-Manned)

**Core Thesis:** Oklo is a pre-revenue company with unproven technology, significant regulatory risk, and a business model that requires billions in capital before generating meaningful revenue, trading at an unjustifiable $12B valuation that assumes flawless execution in an industry with a history of cost overruns and delays.

### Supporting Evidence

**1. Regulatory Risk is Existential and Underappreciated**

The NRC denial in 2022 was not a minor setback—it revealed fundamental gaps:
- **Insufficient information:** NRC found application lacking in multiple key areas
- **Inadequate safety justification:** Core safety methods not properly documented
- **13 years, no approval:** Founded 2013, still in pre-application phase in 2026
- **Competitor comparison:** NuScale achieved certification; Oklo has not
- **Timeline uncertainty:** Even optimistic scenarios suggest 2029 for permits
- **Precedent risk:** If NRC denies again, company value approaches zero

**Historical context:** Advanced reactor licensing is notoriously difficult. The NRC has never approved a commercial fast reactor in the U.S. Oklo is attempting something unprecedented.

**2. Economics are Unproven and Likely Unfavorable**

SMR economics have consistently disappointed:
- **NuScale precedent:** LCOE estimates rose from $58/MWh to $89/MWh due to cost overruns
- **First-of-a-kind (FOAK) costs:** Initial SMRs expected at $180/MWh (Wood Mackenzie)
- **Renewable competition:** Solar at $30/MWh, wind at $37/MWh (2030 NREL estimates)
- **Natural gas:** $46/MWh benchmark
- **SMR target:** $67-94/MWh still 30-200% more expensive than alternatives

**Oklo's specific challenges:**
- **Unproven cost structure:** No operating reactor to validate economics
- **Capital intensity:** Must fund construction of every powerhouse
- **Scale disadvantage:** Smaller reactors (15-75 MW) have worse economics than large nuclear
- **Manufacturing unproven:** Factory fabrication benefits require volume not yet achieved

**Reality check:** If first Aurora costs $500M to build (not unreasonable for FOAK) and generates 50 MW at 85% capacity factor, that's 372 GWh/year. At $80/MWh, revenue is $30M/year. **Payback period: 17 years before considering operating costs.**

**3. HALEU Fuel Supply is a Critical Bottleneck**

The fuel supply chain does not exist at scale:
- **Current domestic capacity:** <1 metric ton/year
- **Projected demand:** 10 MT/year currently, 50 MT/year by 2035
- **Supply gap:** 10x shortage
- **Geopolitical risk:** Russia is primary HALEU supplier globally
- **Timeline risk:** Domestic production ramping but not proven at scale
- **Oklo's recycling facility:** Not operational until early 2030s

**Implication:** Even if NRC approves Aurora, Oklo may not be able to fuel it at scale for years.

**4. Customer Pipeline is Non-Binding and Speculative**

The 14 GW "pipeline" is marketing, not reality:
- **Switch 12 GW:** Non-binding Master Power Agreement through 2044
- **Meta 1.2 GW:** Letter of intent, not binding contract
- **Others 750 MWe:** Letters of intent
- **Conversion risk:** Zero binding PPAs signed
- **Customer optionality:** Data centers can choose grid power, renewables, or other SMRs
- **Pricing uncertainty:** No disclosed pricing terms in public agreements

**Historical precedent:** Non-binding agreements in capital-intensive industries frequently fail to convert. Customers face no penalty for walking away.

**5. Capital Requirements Will Force Massive Dilution**

The math doesn't work with current cash:
- **Current cash:** $1.2B
- **Fuel recycling facility:** $1.68B
- **First Aurora (FOAK):** $300-500M (estimated)
- **Next 5-10 units:** $200-400M each
- **Total need (2026-2030):** $3-5B

**Funding gap:** $2-4B must be raised through equity or debt
- **Equity dilution:** At $75/share, raising $3B requires 40M shares (25-30% dilution)
- **Debt challenge:** Pre-revenue company with unproven technology cannot access cheap debt
- **Valuation risk:** If stock declines, dilution becomes more severe

**6. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**

Actions speak louder than words:
- **$69M+ in insider sales** (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)
- **CEO and COO selling:** The people who know the company best are exiting
- **Timing:** Sales at $80-112/share near 52-week high of $193
- **Pattern:** Consistent selling, no reported insider buying

**Interpretation:** If management believed stock was undervalued with imminent breakthrough, they would be buying, not selling.

**7. Valuation is Absurd for Pre-Revenue Company**

$12B market cap with zero revenue is indefensible:
- **Comparable:** NuScale (NRC-certified, generating revenue) has lower market cap
- **Revenue multiple:** Infinite (no revenue)
- **Path to profitability:** 5-7 years minimum
- **Execution risk:** Every milestone must be hit perfectly
- **Downside scenario:** If delayed to 2030, present value of future cash flows collapses

**Valuation reality check:**
- Current market cap: $12B
- Conservative 2030 revenue (bull case): $300M
- Implied 2030 revenue multiple: 40x
- **This assumes:** Perfect execution, no delays, customer conversion, favorable economics

**Comparable companies:**
- Utilities trade at 1-3x revenue, 10-15x EBITDA
- High-growth utilities: 3-5x revenue, 15-20x EBITDA
- Oklo is priced for perfection with no margin for error

### Key Concerns

**What could go wrong:**
1. **NRC denies COLA again** → Stock drops 70-90%
2. **HALEU supply delays** → Timeline pushed to 2030+
3. **Construction cost overruns** → Economics become uncompetitive
4. **Customer commitments don't convert** → Revenue projections collapse
5. **Renewable + storage costs decline faster** → Nuclear becomes uneconomic
6. **Nuclear incident globally** → Public sentiment turns, regulatory tightening
7. **Capital markets close** → Cannot fund construction, forced to sell assets

**Structural risks:**
- **Technology unproven at commercial scale**
- **Regulatory path uncertain**
- **Capital-intensive business model**
- **Long time to revenue**
- **Competitive alternatives improving**

**Competitive threats:**
- **NuScale:** Already certified, building projects
- **TerraPower:** Bill Gates backing, larger scale
- **Renewables + storage:** Cost curve declining rapidly
- **Grid power:** Simplest solution for most customers

### Downside Scenario (Quantified)

**Bear Case (2028):**
- NRC approval delayed to 2028
- First Aurora operational 2029 (2-year delay)
- Construction costs $600M (20% overrun)
- Only 2 units operational by 2030
- Customer pipeline converts at 10% (1.4 GW)
- Pricing pressure: $60/MWh (renewable competition)
- Additional capital raise: $3B at $40/share (50% dilution)
- **Implied valuation: $2-4B**
- **Downside from current: -67% to -83%**

**Worst Case (2030):**
- NRC denies second COLA or approves with onerous conditions
- Technology pivot required
- Customer pipeline evaporates
- Fuel recycling facility delayed/cancelled
- Company forced to sell assets or merge
- **Implied valuation: $500M - $1B (cash value)**
- **Downside from current: -92% to -96%**

**Conclusion:** Bear case suggests 60-90% downside from current levels if execution falters, regulatory delays occur, or economics prove unfavorable. Current valuation offers no margin of safety.

## 7. Key Uncertainties

### What We Don't Know (And It Matters)

**1. Actual Construction Costs and Economics**

**Uncertainty:** What will it actually cost to build and operate an Aurora powerhouse?
- No FOAK cost data available
- Oklo's estimates are projections, not actuals
- SMR industry has history of cost overruns (NuScale +53%)
- Small reactors typically have worse economics than large ones

**Why it matters:** If construction costs exceed $500M per unit or operating costs are higher than projected, the entire business model breaks down. At $80/MWh pricing, economics only work if capital costs are <$400M per 50 MW unit.

**When we'll know:** 2027-2028 when first Aurora is under construction and costs are disclosed.

**2. NRC Approval Timeline and Conditions**

**Uncertainty:** Will NRC approve the COLA, when, and with what conditions?
- Previous denial in 2022 creates precedent risk
- No commercial fast reactor ever licensed in U.S.
- NRC timeline historically unpredictable
- Approval conditions could make project uneconomic

**Why it matters:** This is binary. No NRC approval = no business. Delayed approval = delayed revenue and increased cash burn. Conditional approval with onerous requirements = uneconomic project.

**When we'll know:**
- COLA submission: Q2 2026 (expected)
- NRC acceptance: Q4 2026 (optimistic)
- Final approval: Late 2026 to 2029 (wide range)

**3. Customer Conversion Rate**

**Uncertainty:** What percentage of 14 GW non-binding pipeline converts to binding PPAs?
- Zero binding contracts disclosed to date
- Pricing terms not public
- Customers have alternatives (grid, renewables, other SMRs)
- Data center power needs may be met by other sources

**Why it matters:** Revenue projections depend entirely on customer conversion. If conversion is 10% instead of 50%, revenue is 80% lower than bull case.

**When we'll know:** 2026-2027 as NRC approval approaches and customers must commit.

**4. HALEU Fuel Supply Availability**

**Uncertainty:** Will domestic HALEU supply scale fast enough to support deployment?
- Current capacity: <1 MT/year
- Oklo's needs: Unknown but substantial for fleet deployment
- DOE commitments: 10 MT by June 2026, but long-term supply uncertain
- Oklo's recycling facility: Not operational until early 2030s

**Why it matters:** Cannot operate reactors without fuel. Supply constraints could delay deployment even with NRC approval.

**When we'll know:** 2026-2027 as domestic HALEU production ramps and DOE releases stockpile.

**5. Competitive Positioning vs. Other SMRs**

**Uncertainty:** Will Oklo win market share vs. NuScale, TerraPower, X-energy?
- NuScale has first-mover advantage (NRC certified)
- TerraPower has Gates backing and larger scale
- X-energy has Amazon investment
- Market may support multiple winners, or winner-take-most dynamics

**Why it matters:** If competitors deploy faster or achieve better economics, Oklo's 14 GW pipeline could evaporate as customers choose alternatives.

**When we'll know:** 2027-2030 as multiple SMR designs reach commercial deployment.

**6. Renewable + Storage Cost Trajectory**

**Uncertainty:** How fast will renewable + storage costs decline?
- Solar/wind costs declining 10-20% per year historically
- Battery storage costs falling rapidly
- Nuclear costs historically rise (learning curve negative)
- Crossover point where renewables + storage < nuclear unclear

**Why it matters:** If renewables + storage become cheaper than nuclear baseload, the entire SMR value proposition collapses. Data centers may choose solar + batteries over nuclear.

**When we'll know:** Continuous evolution, but critical comparison point is 2027-2028 when Oklo comes online.

**7. Insider Selling Rationale**

**Uncertainty:** Why are CEO and COO selling significant equity now?
- **Benign explanation:** Diversification after lockup expiration, pre-planned sales
- **Concerning explanation:** Lack of confidence in near-term execution, selling at peak valuation

**Why it matters:** Insider behavior is often predictive. If management is selling because they expect challenges ahead, current shareholders should be concerned.

**When we'll know:** Ongoing monitoring of insider transactions and company performance.

### Thesis-Breaking Events

**Bull case becomes invalid if:**
1. **NRC denies second COLA** → Regulatory path blocked, pivot required
2. **Construction costs >$600M per unit** → Economics uncompetitive vs. alternatives
3. **Customer pipeline converts <20%** → Revenue projections collapse
4. **HALEU supply unavailable through 2028** → Cannot fuel reactors even if approved
5. **Major nuclear incident globally** → Public sentiment turns, regulatory tightening

**Bear case becomes invalid if:**
1. **NRC approves COLA by Q4 2026** → Regulatory risk substantially reduced
2. **First Aurora operational by Q4 2027** → Execution risk diminished
3. **Construction costs <$300M per unit** → Economics highly competitive
4. **Switch/Meta sign binding PPAs** → Revenue visibility increases dramatically
5. **Fuel recycling facility operational by 2029** → Vertical integration advantage realized

### Critical Monitoring Points

**Q1-Q2 2026:**
- COLA submission to NRC
- Customer conversion announcements
- Additional capital raise (if needed)

**Q3-Q4 2026:**
- NRC acceptance of COLA for review
- Construction permit progress
- HALEU supply developments

**2027:**
- NRC approval decision
- First Aurora construction start
- Binding PPA announcements
- Actual construction costs disclosed

**2028:**
- First Aurora commissioning
- Initial revenue generation
- Fleet deployment acceleration
- Economics validation

## 8. Valuation Context

**Disclaimer:** The following valuation analysis is for context only and does not constitute a price target or investment recommendation. Valuation of pre-revenue companies is highly speculative and dependent on numerous uncertain assumptions.

### Current Valuation Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Market Cap | $11.78 - $12.19B | Extremely high for pre-revenue |
| Enterprise Value | ~$11B (net of cash) | Implies significant future value |
| P/E Ratio | N/A | No earnings |
| P/S Ratio | N/A | No sales |
| P/B Ratio | 10.04x | High premium to book value |
| EV/Pipeline | $785/kW | Based on 14 GW pipeline |
| Price/Cash | 10x | Trading at 10x cash holdings |

### Valuation Approaches

**Method 1: Comparable Company Analysis**

| Company | Market Cap | Status | EV/Capacity | Notes |

**Bear Case Scenario (25% probability):**
- 2029: First revenue (delayed)
- 2030: 200 MW operational
- 2035: 1,000 MW operational
- 2035 Revenue: $600M
- **NPV: $1.5B**

**Probability-Weighted Valuation:**
- (0.50 × $3.5B) + (0.25 × $8B) + (0.25 × $1.5B) = **$4.1B**

**Current Price:** $12B
**Implied Downside to Fair Value:** -66%

**Method 3: Revenue Multiple Approach**

**2030 Revenue Projections:**
- Bear: $150M (2 units, delays)
- Base: $300M (10 units, on track)
- Bull: $600M (20 units, accelerated)

**Comparable Revenue Multiples:**
- Mature utilities: 1-3x revenue
- Growth utilities: 3-5x revenue
- High-growth infrastructure: 5-8x revenue

**Applying 2030 multiples (discounted to 2026):**
- Bear: $150M × 3x × 0.64 (4-year discount) = **$288M**
- Base: $300M × 5x × 0.64 = **$960M**
- Bull: $600M × 7x × 0.64 = **$2.7B**

**Probability-weighted:** $1.3B
**Current price:** $12B
**Implied downside:** -89%

### Valuation Summary Table

| Method | Bear Case | Base Case | Bull Case | Prob-Weighted |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|

## 10. Conclusion

### Balanced Synthesis

Oklo Inc. represents a high-risk, high-reward investment in the emerging small modular reactor industry. The company has assembled impressive customer interest (14 GW pipeline), developed differentiated fast reactor technology with fuel recycling capabilities, and secured substantial capital ($1.2B+) to fund development. The AI/data center power boom creates a genuine and growing market opportunity that could support multiple SMR winners.

**However**, the current $12B valuation appears to price in near-perfect execution with minimal margin for safety. The company is pre-revenue, pre-regulatory approval, and 2-3 years away from first commercial operations. The 2022 NRC denial, significant insider selling, and unproven economics create substantial downside risk. Comparable analysis and DCF modeling suggest fair value in the $2-5B range, implying 60-80% downside from current levels.

### Investment Recommendation: NEUTRAL (Hold/Wait)

**For Current Shareholders:**
- **Hold if:** You have high conviction in management execution and can tolerate 60-80% drawdown risk
- **Trim if:** Position is >5% of portfolio (risk management)
- **Sell if:** You need capital or cannot stomach volatility

**For Prospective Investors:**
- **Wait for:** NRC COLA submission and initial feedback (Q2-Q3 2026)
- **Consider entry if:** Stock pulls back to $40-60 range (50-65% downside) OR NRC approves COLA
- **Avoid at current levels unless:** You have very high risk tolerance and long time horizon (5-10 years)

### Confidence Level: LOW

**Why low confidence:**
1. **Binary regulatory risk:** NRC approval is unpredictable
2. **No operating data:** Economics are theoretical
3. **Long timeline:** 2-3 years to validation
4. **High valuation:** Little margin for error
5. **Competitive uncertainty:** Multiple SMR designs competing

**Confidence would increase with:**
- NRC COLA approval → Medium confidence
- First Aurora operational → High confidence
- Economics validated → Very high confidence

### Key Takeaways

**What the Market is Right About:**
1. SMR/microreactor market is real and growing rapidly
2. AI/data center power demand is a genuine tailwind
3. Oklo has secured impressive customer interest
4. Fast reactor technology with fuel recycling is differentiated
5. Management has strong technical credentials

**What the Market is Wrong About:**
1. Execution risk is underpriced - 2022 NRC denial was significant
2. Timeline optimism - delays are more likely than acceleration
3. Economics are unproven - FOAK costs typically exceed estimates
4. Customer pipeline is non-binding - conversion risk is high
5. Valuation assumes perfection - no margin of safety

**The Bottom Line:**
Oklo is a compelling long-term story in a growing market, but the current valuation leaves no room for the inevitable setbacks that occur in capital-intensive, regulated industries. Patient investors should wait for regulatory de-risking or significant price pullback before establishing positions.
