## ⚡ Update — February 16, 2026

**Stock Price:** $65.69 (down ~7.5% from $71 at initial report date)
**Market Cap:** ~$10.2B

### Key Developments This Week

1. **Meta Partnership Formalized as Binding Agreement:** The Oklo-Meta 1.2GW nuclear campus deal has been confirmed as a binding agreement. The campus will be located on 206 acres in Pike County, Ohio (former DOE land). Meta will provide prepayments and upfront funding for early development and nuclear fuel procurement. Pre-construction and site characterization to begin in 2026, first phase online ~2030, full 1.2GW by 2034. This is a significant de-risking event — moving from a cooperation agreement to a binding commitment with capital backing from Meta.

2. **Analyst Activity:**
   - Goldman Sachs lowered price target from $106 → $91 (Neutral)
   - Texas Capital Securities initiated coverage with Buy / $138 PT (Jan 28)
   - Bank of America raised PT to $127 (Jan 21)
   - Consensus PT: ~$112.69 across 19 analysts (range: $44–$175)

3. **Insider Selling:** CFO Richard Craig Bealmear sold 9,726 shares for ~$748K in early February, reducing his position by 4.71%.

4. **Stock Decline Context:** OKLO has fallen >30% from its 52-week high of ~$194 (Oct 2025). The pullback reflects broader re-rating of pre-revenue nuclear names on execution timeline concerns, despite the Meta deal strengthening the commercial pipeline.

### Thesis Impact

No material change to investment thesis. The Meta binding agreement is incrementally positive (reduces commercial risk), but the stock decline reflects the market pricing in longer timelines and execution uncertainty. The core tension remains: exceptional pipeline vs. zero revenue and 2-4 year wait for first commercial operations.

---

## Executive Summary

**One-Line Thesis:** Oklo is one of the most imaginative plays in the advanced nuclear space, with $1.2B in cash, a 14.7GW+ project pipeline, and marquee customers like Meta, but as a zero-revenue pre-commercial company, its ~$10.2B market cap is built entirely on faith in a 5-10 year vision.

**Investment Verdict:**
- Neutral | Conviction Level: Low (extremely high uncertainty)
- Key Catalyst: NRC license approval + Idaho first reactor progress + Meta Ohio project launch

## 6. Bull Case 🐂

**Core Thesis:** Oklo is at the forefront of the AI-driven nuclear renaissance, with a 14.7GW pipeline and marquee customers validating demand. Once the first reactor operates successfully, exponential growth begins.

**Supporting Evidence:**

**1. AI Data Center Nuclear Demand Is Structural**
- Global AI data center power demand expected to grow 3-5x by 2030
- Nuclear is the only option for 24/7 stable, zero-carbon, large-scale baseload power
- Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft all actively pursuing nuclear
- Meta 1.2GW and Switch 12GW contracts prove demand is real

**2. First-Mover Advantage and Regulatory Moat**
- First company to receive DOE site use permit for commercial advanced fission plant
- First to submit custom combined license application for advanced fission to NRC
- Selected for DOE Reactor Pilot Program
- Once regulatory approval is secured, followers need years to catch up

**3. Fuel Recycling Is Unique Differentiation**
- First U.S. nuclear fuel recycling facility (Tennessee)
- Reduces long-term fuel costs, creates closed loop
- Radioisotope production (Atomic Alchemy) provides additional revenue stream
- Ongoing DOE funding ($19M in February 2026)

**4. Ample Cash, Long Runway**
- $1.2B cash, zero debt
- 15+ years runway at current burn rate
- Meta prepaying for power provides additional funding

**5. Analyst Consensus Is Bullish**
- Consensus rating: Buy
- Average target: $103-122 (+45-72% upside)
- Bank of America target $127, Canaccord Genuity target $175

**Key Assumptions:**
- NRC approves combined license in 2026-2027
- Idaho first reactor operational by 2027-2028
- HALEU fuel supply issues resolved

**Upside Scenario:** First reactor success + NRC approval + pipeline conversion >30%, 2030 revenue could reach hundreds of millions, market cap could double to $20-25B.

## 7. Bear Case 🐻

**Core Thesis:** Oklo is an $11.7B "PowerPoint company" — zero revenue, zero operating reactors, zero commercial validation. The valuation is built entirely on a 5-10 year vision, and nuclear project history is littered with delays, cost overruns, and failures.

**Supporting Evidence:**

**1. Valuation Is Absurd**
- $11.7B market cap with zero revenue
- Even under the most optimistic 2030 revenue forecast ($500M-1B), current valuation implies extreme growth expectations
- Comparison: NuScale (only SMR with NRC design certification) has market cap of only ~$4B
- Price/Book ~9-10x, far above industry average of 1.9x
- Essentially paying a "success premium" for unproven technology

**2. Technology and Execution Risk Is Extreme**
- Aurora reactor has never operated in a commercial environment
- 2020 NRC rejection exposed technology maturity gaps
- Sodium-cooled fast reactors have multiple historical failures (Japan's Monju, France's Superphénix)
- "Valley of death" risk from lab to commercialization
- Construction costs and timelines may significantly exceed expectations

**3. Pipeline Is Heavily "Inflated"**
- 12GW of 14.7GW pipeline comes from a single non-binding Switch agreement
- Non-binding = customer can walk away at any time
- LOI (Letter of Intent) ≠ Contract ≠ Revenue
- Actual binding contract value is minimal
- Pipeline conversion rate may be far below market expectations

**4. Ongoing Dilution**
- $540M ATM financing in 2025, diluting shareholders ~20-30%
- Significant additional CapEx needed before commercialization
- Each financing round dilutes existing shareholders
- If stock price drops, financing becomes more expensive, creating a vicious cycle

**5. Regulatory Uncertainty**
- NRC's advanced reactor approval framework still evolving
- Approval timeline may be much longer than expected
- Political environment changes could affect nuclear policy
- HALEU fuel supply depends on Russia (geopolitical risk)

**6. Competition Intensifying**
- NuScale already has NRC design certification (Oklo does not)
- TerraPower (Bill Gates-backed) building Natrium reactor in Wyoming
- Kairos Power receiving substantial DOE funding
- X-energy, Terrestrial Energy also advancing
- Large traditional nuclear companies (Westinghouse, GE Hitachi) entering SMR market

**Downside Scenario:** NRC delays + first reactor cost overruns + pipeline conversion <10%, market cap could shrink to $3-5B (-60~75%).

## 8. Key Uncertainties

### ❓ What We Don't Know

**1. Can the Aurora Reactor Operate as Planned?**
- Why it matters: Foundation of the entire investment thesis
- When we'll know: 2027-2028 Idaho first reactor commissioning

**2. Will NRC Ultimately Approve the Combined License?**
- Why it matters: No license = no commercial operations
- When we'll know: 2026-2027

**3. Real Construction Cost and Timeline Data**
- Why it matters: Nuclear projects historically run over budget and schedule
- When we'll know: After Idaho first reactor completion

**4. Pipeline Conversion Rate**
- Why it matters: How much of 14.7GW becomes real contracts and revenue?
- When we'll know: 2026-2028

**5. HALEU Fuel Supply Chain**
- Why it matters: Aurora requires HALEU fuel, currently in limited supply
- When we'll know: 2026-2027 (DOE fuel program progress)

### Thesis-Breaking Events

- If NRC rejects license application again → Bull case severely damaged
- If Idaho first reactor operates on time and on budget → Bear case significantly weakened
- If Meta cancels or significantly reduces Ohio project → Pipeline credibility questioned

## 11. Conclusion

Oklo is the most talked-about and imaginative name in the advanced nuclear space. $1.2B in cash, a 14.7GW+ pipeline, marquee customers like Meta and Switch, ongoing DOE support — these are all real positives. Sam Altman's endorsement and the structural demand for nuclear power from AI data centers add further appeal.

However, viewed soberly: this is a zero-revenue, zero-operating-reactor company with an $11.7B market cap. The Aurora reactor has never operated commercially, the NRC license hasn't been approved, and the vast majority of the 14.7GW pipeline consists of non-binding agreements. Nuclear project history is filled with delays, cost overruns, and failures.

**Our View:**
- Oklo is a "high-conviction" investment — you either believe in advanced nuclear's future or you don't
- At ~$71, the stock is roughly at probability-weighted fair value
- Not suitable for risk-averse investors
- If investing, keep position size controlled (no more than 3-5% of portfolio) and prepare for potential 50%+ losses
- Key watchpoints: NRC license progress, Idaho first reactor construction pace, cash burn rate

**Key Changes from Previous Report:**
- Cash increased from $275M to $1.2B (ATM financing $540M+)
- Pipeline grew from ~2.1GW to 14.7GW+ (Switch 12GW agreement)
- Idaho first reactor broke ground
- Meta Ohio project officially launched
- Ongoing DOE grants and support
- Stock price pulled back from $193 high to $71 (-63%)

**Confidence Level: Low** — Extremely high uncertainty; outcome is highly binary (major success or major failure).
